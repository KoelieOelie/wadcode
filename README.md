# wadcode
wadcode is a WAD Compiler/Decompiler. It is supposed to disassemble WAD files
that provide all the resources for games like Doom into individual files that
can then be edited. Ideally it should be able to recompile those files back
into a WAD to use.

Warning: Right now this is all highly experimental and doesn't work correctly,
yet.

## Dependencies
wadcode requires the pypng package to be installed.

## License
GNU-GPL 3.
